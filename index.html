            <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer + Computer Science Student</h2>
            <img src="images/self-portrait.jpg" alt="self-portrait" id="self-portrait">
            <p>Recently graduated from a program that allows me to attain an Associate Degree at 18 with full-time dual-enrollment, I have found a unique passion for software engineering, machine learning, and higher level mathematics. In the past few semesters, I have taken on rigorous programming courses and found both talent and joy in the subject. Hoping to become a back-end developer or machine learning engineer, I continue to strive for academic excellence and career readiness in the field.</p>
            <p>I am a current Class of 2027 Freshman at the University of Central Florida, and I am involved in a variety of organizations that help me achieve my mission, including the Competitive Programming Team and KnightHacks Software Development Club. I also plan on participating in a handful of Hackathons in the upcoming months, which I am excited to utilize for professional and personal development.</p>
